1247169787723239425,2020-04-06 14:30:23,Help is coming—more financial help than ever before. But it is too slow. The government can’t replace lost wages in real time. Mississippians are proud. Many won’t broadcast they need help. But a lot of them do. Please consider quietly reaching out to help a neighbor if you can.
1247169785152114689,2020-04-06 14:30:22,"This disease is not fair. It does not hit the rich and the rest equally. Neither does the economic fallout. There are many across Mississippi who are struggling, waiting as we work to scale up our unemployment system to manage the 3,000% increase in claims."
1247135075306737666,2020-04-06 12:12:27,"The faith, calm, and loving spirit demonstrated by so many Mississippians during a tragedy like this is truly humbling. You are daily motivating me to try and reflect your grit, humility, and courage. Live update at 2:30–detailed briefing on hospital surge plans. God bless."
1246944146855731204,2020-04-05 23:33:46,"There are some new solutions in the works to deal with the historic increase. It’s going to get fixed. And we’re going to provide more help than ever before. 

Stay safe, and look out for your neighbors. Many need food and some cash to get by until we can get this right."
1246944145383608320,2020-04-05 23:33:46,"You will get what you deserve, no matter when you get through. Your money is based on when you lost your job, not when they can answer the phone."
1246944144406261760,2020-04-05 23:33:45,"We’ve increased the hours. We’ve increased the staff. We’ve increased the ways you can apply. We’re still trying to catch up with the massive numbers. 

That doesn’t help you if you’re trying to get through and can’t. I know that. We’re going to make it right."
1246944142372061184,2020-04-05 23:33:45,"No system was created to handle that kind of drastic increase. The people on the line at the call center are working class folks. They’re trying, but they’re being asked to do 3,000% more work instantly."
1246944140803420160,2020-04-05 23:33:44,"This is not just a pandemic, it is an economic disaster. We’ve already seen a 3,000% increase in unemployment claims in Mississippi. It’s never happened before. That is going to get worse before it gets better, just like this disease."
1246871364105056256,2020-04-05 18:44:33,"The church isn’t a building. Easter isn’t about eggs. We will come together virtually around the globe, and personally in our families. Celebrate Easter next Sunday, please! Just be smart and safe. Christ is risen!"
1246871363501133827,2020-04-05 18:44:33,"They’ve celebrated in countries where large Christian gatherings don’t mean you risk infection—you risk execution. They’ve worshipped on battlefields. They’ve worshipped in the wild. If they can do that, we can stay home to watch and worship on TV, radio, or the internet."
1246871361596862464,2020-04-05 18:44:33,A disease can’t cancel Easter. Jesus conquered death. Christians have celebrated the resurrection in even harder times than these:

You’re welcome to join us! We are going to make it through this by looking out for one another. We are going to get through. God bless.
1246468134359502849,2020-04-04 16:02:16,"We will get our economy rolling again. There are people whose lives and livelihoods are as threatened by the national economic damage as any disease. We will protect you too, to the best of our ability. We also have to take this virus very, very seriously."
1246468050053992449,2020-04-04 16:01:56,"I don’t say this to make you panic, but we all need a healthy, educated respect of this powerful enemy. It is real. It is deadly. And Mississippi is uniquely threatened. Please be smart, stay home, and take care of your neighbors."
1246467966973157376,2020-04-04 16:01:36,"All of those models assume people will socially distance and shelter in place. We are trying to prevent the health care system from being overloaded. If you could survive with quality care, we need you to get that care. That is what all of this is for."
1246467863768109058,2020-04-04 16:01:11,"We had a pandemic plan and we’ve followed it. We didn’t have to scramble; we were able to be methodical in ramping things up. It hasn’t hit us hard yet, but it will."
1246467779521363969,2020-04-04 16:00:51,We have advantages. We’re more spread out. We’ve done much more testing than others.   We’ve gathered and studied the data.  We have great health care workers.  Our emergency managers are 2nd to none.
1246467705873608709,2020-04-04 16:00:33,"We are #2 in obesity. In diabetics, we are #3. Hypertension #4, smokers #6. We have risks that other parts of the country just don’t. We are already seeing that MS has a very high hospitalization per case rate compared to other states."
1246467619131179009,2020-04-04 16:00:13,"But consider this: New Orleans has a death rate that is 7X New York’s. Why? The demographics are different. If you are less healthy to begin with, this virus can be more serious and deadly. Mississippi’s population looks a lot more like Louisiana than New York."
1246467542157271043,2020-04-04 15:59:54,"The national models project that America might have 100,000 to 250,000 deaths from COVID-19 if everyone social distances. Mississippi represents about 1% of the US population. That means, if it hit everyone equally, Mississippi would expect 1,000 to 2,500 deaths.

1245843884443230208,2020-04-02 22:41:43,People like to talk down Mississippi or turn us into a caricature. Mississippi is stepping up to fight this disease and our scientists are leading the way.

1245843531836452865,2020-04-02 22:40:19,This is just the beginning. We are going to further ramp up testing as part of our “Identify and Isolate” model—based in large part on the success of South Korea. It’s possible because Mississippi innovators have stepped up. All credit to them.
1245843435199873024,2020-04-02 22:39:56,We have a population that is very susceptible to this virus. Keep that in mind. We have issued a shelter-in-place because we think we are close to hitting the worst weeks of this soon. Stay home. Stay safe.

1245843219730108417,2020-04-02 22:39:04,"Everyone has hailed South Korea for their robust testing. They tested about 5,200 of their citizens per every million. We have now exceeded that metric in Mississippi. We’re at more than 5,500 tests per million residents."
1245843124058042368,2020-04-02 22:38:42,"VA has done 15,344 tests. Their population is nearly triple ours. KY has about 1.5 million more residents than we do.
