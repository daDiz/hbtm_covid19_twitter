1247242762518396930,2020-04-06 19:20:21,".@DrAmyActon: Double down on your commitment, Ohio. Let's fight this together. We do not want to be passive and let this virus own us. We need to own everything that is in our control. #InThisTogetherOhio #StayHomeOhio"
1247242516799291393,2020-04-06 19:19:23,".@DrAmyActon: I don't think this is our peak week. I think our peak will be further out. But, what we're doing today is contributing to controlling the surge. Don't give up. Our ability to control this storm is in our hands. A huge part of it is what we are doing collectively."
1247241243760959490,2020-04-06 19:14:19,"Another thing: The number of prisoners coming in every week is going down, and that in itself is taking our population down. We want to give our prison officials more flexibility to move inmates around to better settings to reduce the spread of #COVID19."
1247240907440750592,2020-04-06 19:12:59,We're going through a tough analysis of who we can release on different conditions. I don't have the power to release inmates quickly -- that's why this weekend we sent a first batch of inmates to judges to consider judicial release. We will be announcing more tomorrow.
1247240904206880768,2020-04-06 19:12:58,"I want to assure everyone who works in a prison, those who have family in prison, those who are in prison: We will do everything we can every day. This is something we will continue to battle, but @DRCOhio is doing a great deal to minimize inmate contact and stop #COVID19 spread."
1247239658343448583,2020-04-06 19:08:01,.@DrAmyActon: You all are moving mountains. You are saving lives. I get emotional when I talk about this. This is no small thing we are doing together. It's hard to shut down our lives the way we have. I know we will look back and know that we all saved each other in this state. https://t.co/txHytUiRt4
1247237256089415682,2020-04-06 18:58:29,".@DrAmyActon: We need to double the hospital capacity to handle the upcoming surge. But our social distancing has absolutely had an impact. This is going to be a hard week, and we have a couple hard weeks ahead. But we can't let up. The moment we let up it will all unravel. https://t.co/JHdcF0C7Df"
1247236501026504710,2020-04-06 18:55:29,".@DrAmyActon: To those impacted by #COVID19, we are thinking of you and we care about you. We will do everything we can to give you the best care in #Ohio."
1247235934866767875,2020-04-06 18:53:14,"The second we can do widespread testing of the population, it's crucial to do that in a way that provides a good picture of race, ethnicity, the disabled, elderly, those dealing w/ life-threating illnesses, etc. -- we must not leave anyone behind. https://t.co/HhlsqtryEV"
1247235394275627009,2020-04-06 18:51:05,"Cases/deaths by race and ethnicity in #Ohio. ⬇️ 25% of cases don't have race listed, and 39% don't list ethnicity.

1247231086020767745,2020-04-06 18:33:57,"For those coming into #Ohio after being out of state: To be clear, we're not talking about medical professionals, truckers, or those providing essential services. The order applies to those who vacationed elsewhere, went to a meeting in another state, etc."
1247230738019344385,2020-04-06 18:32:35,We are working with mobile food vendors to set up to provide truckers options for hot meals b/c the restaurant options are limited today.

The trucking industry is always a vital part of our economy. Their jobs are even more important now. We know this is a challenging time for this industry as it is for all of us. We're trying to make things easier for them. https://t.co/cawkjdoeFN"
1247230196027133953,2020-04-06 18:30:25,"Overall we are doing pretty well. Ohioans are doing the right thing, and we can't let up. But we do have the concern that people coming in from other states will bring #COVID19 in with them."
1247229954372374528,2020-04-06 18:29:28,"Snowbirds coming back to #Ohio from places like Florida: Welcome back, we want you back -- but anyone coming back into Ohio (a resident or non-resident) must quarantine for 14 days."
1247229743474315267,2020-04-06 18:28:37,"We're not going to release anyone who is dangerous. We aren't releasing sex offenders, for example. We're going through the prisoners and taking a look at who might be getting close to release and who is in for a minor offense."
1247229467543638016,2020-04-06 18:27:32,We are testing those who have symptoms. Each employee is screened when they arrive and their temperature is taken. @DRCOhio has decreased programming with citizens from outside the facility. We will talk more tomorrow about more steps we will take re: releasing prisoners.
1247229125137498113,2020-04-06 18:26:10,"Ohio Prisons:

5 inmates positive in Marion 
5 inmates positive in Pickaway Co 

Staff: 27 positive at 4 facilities, but most come from Marion."
1247228876218122241,2020-04-06 18:25:11,"Additionally, we’ve been receiving calls from family members of inmates at Elkton asking us to release the federal prisoners. I want to be clear that Ohio does not have the authority to release federal prisoners."
1247228874489987073,2020-04-06 18:25:10,"In the meantime, I do, however, feel it necessary to make a plea to both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Prisons to stop prisoner intake at this facility."
1247228872132870148,2020-04-06 18:25:10,"As we've all said for weeks, we’re all in this together and providing state help for this federal prison is the right thing to do."
1247228869851131904,2020-04-06 18:25:09,"The @OHNationalGuard also stands ready to help with transporting the seriously ill patients to the hospital in the event of a surge. In addition to the staff, the guard will be bringing equipment and ambulances with them as well."
1247228868060237826,2020-04-06 18:25:09,These soldiers – who all work in the medical field - will have N-95 respirators for protection while they work to augment the current prison medical staff. They will treat those they can while triaging others with serious symptoms for hospital care.
1247228866038546438,2020-04-06 18:25:08,"They’ll be there to assist with non-COVID cases, as well as with those who are showing symptoms of this highly contagious, deadly disease."
1247228286628921344,2020-04-06 18:22:50,"We have an advance team from the guard there today, and we are prepared to send at least 26 guardsmen and women to the prison to help in the Elkton infirmary. This is a medical mission only. The guard members will not be armed and they will not be providing security."
1247228284791709700,2020-04-06 18:22:50,That’s why today I am announcing that I have authorized the Ohio National Guard to go into Elkton prison to assist. This is limited in duration and scope. Right now the plan is to go into the prison for 7-10 days until more federal assistance arrives.
1247228282975784960,2020-04-06 18:22:49,"To be clear, this is not a state facility – But this prison is in #Ohio. Ohio citizens work there. Their families live here. When an inmate gets sick, they are transferred to local hospitals with Ohio doctors and nurses."
1247228281151160326,2020-04-06 18:22:49,".@OhioAdjGen tells me that Elkton’s medical staffing right now is at 50%. And, for every 1 federal inmate at the hospital, they need 2 federal guards standing watch."
1247227760944336898,2020-04-06 18:20:45,"Update on federal prison in Ohio – Elkton Federal Correctional Institution in Columbiana County. This is a federal, not state facility. We know that 7 inmates have tested positive COVID-19 – but we also know that dozens more have shown symptoms – some very serious. 3 have died."
1247227577711951873,2020-04-06 18:20:01,Everything you are doing in #Ohio is making a difference. We are all making a difference. We will do all we can to protect our protectors. We’ll leave no stone unturned to find what we need.
1247227223553294338,2020-04-06 18:18:37,The @JobsOhio team provides input as part of the alliance and assists the state with rapid procurement requirements and identifying viable solutions.  I want to also thank former Governor @JohnKasich for creating JobsOhio - it is a tool we are using as we go through this crisis.
1247227030476853249,2020-04-06 18:17:51,A shoutout to @JobsOhio - shifted its business development effort and is now working to shore-up this critical supply chain. They know our manufacturing sector and what they can bring to the table.
1247226918740639745,2020-04-06 18:17:24,We have had at least 1400 Ohio manufacturing companies who have responded to our call to try and help in this crisis.  The Ohio Manufacturing Alliance reaches out to each company to find out where they fit into our strategy.
1247226797273551014,2020-04-06 18:16:55,"We appreciate all the medical professionals, companies, schools, colleges and universities, and individuals that have given PPE to our effort.  In times of crisis, as we have seen throughout our history, Ohioans act with great generosity, and so we #thankyou."
1247226673466150912,2020-04-06 18:16:25,"And once we have our supplies, we’re going to use technology and innovation to identify ways to make our supplies last. A prime example is @Battelle is doing this right now, sterilizing masks for our healthcare workers. This is a great tool."
1247226539684630529,2020-04-06 18:15:54,"As I’ve said before, we are too reliant on foreign marketplaces for our health care supplies. The efforts we’re making now in Ohio to address this crisis will help us today and I believe will strengthen our manufacturing sector in the future."
1247226432960507904,2020-04-06 18:15:28,"Procurement Update: As we continue to move through this crisis, we are working to ensure that our health care workers have the #PPE they need.

1244704380936433664,2020-03-30 19:13:44,We have similar protocols at @OhioDYS and our state psychiatric hospitals.
1244703933815234560,2020-03-30 19:11:57,Re Prisons: @DRCOhio instituted some time ago a practice of checking on every employee who comes in. Every staff member is encouraged to stay home if ill. They take the temperature of every employee coming in.
